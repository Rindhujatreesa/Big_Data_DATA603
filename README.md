# Big Data

## What is Big Data?

"Big data is a term for massive data sets having a large, more varied, and complex structure with the difficulties of storing, analyzing, and visualizing for further processes or results *(Sagiroglu & Sinanc, 2013)*". 

## Examples or Sources of Big Data

We come across big data in a variety of forms and almost everywhere. According to the McKinsey Global Institute, big data has five potential sources or topics, *(Manyika, et al., 2011)* they are -  
- **Healthcare**: This sector has multiple and varied stakeholders from the pharmaceuticals and medical products industries to the consumer, i.e., the patients. The massive inflow of data from all the stakeholders is vital in the health industry business analysis *(Manyika, et al., 2011)*.
- **Public sector**: The availability of massive public data gives governments an advantage if used appropriately, to improve performance and transparency *(Manyika, et al., 2011)*. 
- **Retail**: In this sector, big data can be used to segment customers and manage supply chains in the most efficient manner *(Manyika, et al., 2011)*.
- **Manufacturing**: Like the retail sector, the manufacturing sector utilizes big data in the analysis of the points in the value chain to decide on the places where the market, research, and development have to be altered or improved *(Manyika, et al., 2011)*.
- **Personal location data**: Location data cuts across all industries and sectors. Smartphones add to the generation of this data which is available for organizations to analyze their customer behaviors *(Manyika, et al., 2011)*.
